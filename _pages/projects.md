<strong><a href="http://informed-ai.net">INFORMED-AI</a> (2024–ongoing)</strong><br>
UKRI-funded AI research hub conducted jointly by four UK universities: Bristol, Cambridge, Durham, and Imperial College.The hub aims to advance the mathematical foundations of AI, studying collective intelligence, information-theoretic learning, and decision-making in distributed systems. Within this hub, I focus on modelling, adapting, and personalising robotic behaviours based on human-robot interactions, with applications in assistive robotics. My work includes anticipating user intentions, fusing data from distributed and heterogeneous sensors, and adapting robot behaviours to user needs.

<strong><a href="https://trust.tas.ac.uk">UKRI TAS Node on Trust</a> (2023–2024)</strong><br>
UKRI-funded multidisciplinary project in collaboration with the University of Manchester, Heriot-Watt University, and Imperial College. Investigates trust in robotic and autonomous systems. I contributed to adaptive machine learning methods for human-robot collaboration, developing models that maintain reliable trust across varying users, tasks, and real-world conditions.
