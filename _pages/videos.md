**Florespiña – Tribute to Ana Kiro**  
I took part in the [AI Song Contest](https://www.aisongcontest.com/) 2023 as a member of the Spanish team PAMP. This music and multimedia project celebrates Galician singer Ana Kiro, highlighting her feminism and resilience. The song was the public favourite and won the Audience Trophy. The video portrays her career metaphorically through the thorny flower (*florespiña*) and combines traditional music with AI-driven production, including artificial voice models and generative visuals.
