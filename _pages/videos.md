Teleoperating a Dual-Arm Wheelchair using Hand Tracking 
: A demo of a smart robotic wheelchair with two Kinova Gen3 arms and two Inspire-Robots hands, teleoperated using only hand motions via a Leap Motion sensor. The interface enables full control of the 28-DoF platform, including both arms, both hands, and navigation, allowing a single operator to collect high-quality demonstrations for future learning-based assistive behaviours.

DIWIE: Diffusion-based User Intention Estimation for Wheelchair Assistance  
: Supplementary video for our T-RO paper *"Navigating Uncertainty: Diffusion-based User Intention Estimation for Wheelchair Assistance"*. Shows DIWIE, a multimodal framework that predicts wheelchair user intentions under uncertainty using diffusion models. Includes visual explanations of the system, model architecture, and qualitative results.

Florespiña – Tribute to Ana Kiro 
: I took part in the [AI Song Contest](https://www.aisongcontest.com/) 2023 as a member of the Spanish team PAMP. This music and multimedia project celebrates Galician singer Ana Kiro, highlighting her feminism and resilience. The song was the public favourite and won the Audience Trophy. The video portrays her career metaphorically through the thorny flower (*florespiña*) and combines traditional music with AI-driven production, including artificial voice models and generative visuals.

AI Agent for Smartphone Racing Game (Traffic Rider)  
: A casual project made just for fun. I trained an AI agent to play the mobile racing game *Traffic Rider* by imitating real players. The agent learns directly from vision-only inputs (game frames), achieving high speeds and high scores while avoiding crashes.
