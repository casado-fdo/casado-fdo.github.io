  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="small"><p>
    Hi, I'm Fernando. I am an AI and robotics researcher with over seven years of experience developing machine learning solutions and robotic systems. At Imperial College London, I work on robot learning and user modelling, with applications in assistive technologies such as smart wheelchairs and collaborative robotic arms.  
    I enjoy bridging research and real-world applications, working in diverse, international teams where different perspectives come together. Over the years, I have had the chance to collaborate with interdisciplinary teams spanning diverse research and engineering backgrounds, as well as end users â€” experiences that have shaped the way I approach technology as something to be useful, practical, and human-centred.
